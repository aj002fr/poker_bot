"""Observation and view types shared by bots, the API and the browser (schema version 1).

These are the stable contracts documented in ``docs/observations-and-projections.md``
and pinned by the JSON Schemas in ``docs/schemas/``. Build them only through
:mod:`arena.table.projections`; never construct them from the private event log or
engine objects by hand.

Chips are integers. Seats are the table's physical seat numbers (0..7), which are
anonymous: they carry no account or artifact identity.
